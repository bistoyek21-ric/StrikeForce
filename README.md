**StrikeForce** is an open-source, simple online game with a 1970s style. Experience exciting shooter gameplay and enjoy battle royale matches, available on Windows, Unix-based operating systems, and Apple devices.

This project also has a scientific aspect. You can create AI bots and have them compete against each other to see who wins. Additionally, you can use this project to train single or multi agent or Collective Intelligence AI models. This open-source environment for ML and AI development can serve as the basis for many research studies on learning methods.

We organize events focusing on different parts of this game, especially the AI Battle Royale section. For more information about AI contests and to participate in the development of this project or other open-source projects directed by [@bistoyek-official](https://github.com/bistoyek-official), join our Telegram [channel](https://t.me/StrikeForce21).
